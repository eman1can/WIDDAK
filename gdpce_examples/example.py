""" Executable script that build an example structure in the center of the build area.

    The purpose of this file is to demonstrate the usage of the core GDPC 5.0 enhancements provided
    by this repository. It does not demonstrate every enhancement, and it assumes some familiarity
    with the base GDPC framework.

    The following enhancements are demonstrated:
    - Vectors and various vector math utilities.
    - The Transform class and the use of local coordinate systems.
    - The placement of blocks with NBT data.
    - The placement of saved models.

    To install or learn more about the base GDPC framework, visit
