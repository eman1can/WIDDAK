# GDMC 2021 - Hunternif

This is a Forge mod submission for the Generative Design in Minecraft Competition.

It doesn't really build a settlement, rather it builds a castle on the nearest mountain.

## Usage

After installing the mod, you'll be able to invoke the generator by running the `buildsettlement` command.

```
/buildsettlement <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2>
```
