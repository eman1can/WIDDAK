# Description

My entry is an iterative agent simulation that uses human-like behaviour to create organic settlements. It also generates a chronicle for the chronicle challenge! It uses Nils' HTTP Server.

For a detailed explanation, see the WIP paper draft!

I'll include an example save, where a large settlement is generated at position (88, 68, -52).

# This project would not have been possible without:
* Nils Gawlik for their http server, which let's me communicate with a running Minecraft process!
* Nevas Buildings for their permission to use and edit their beautiful buildings!
* Asiiah Song & Jim Whitehead for their TownSim generator, which largely inspired the road generation system!
* Max Kreminski for their guidance and coauthoring the paper!
* Blinkenlights for their optimization help!
* Troy, Ryan, & Trent for their pathfinding code in their 2020 entry!

# NOTE for judges:
Tested on Minecraft 1.16.5, with Python 3.9
Required packages are:
bitarray numpy names nbt requests scipy wonderwords

The command line argument for 1000x1000 testing should probably be:
python3 run.py -a {x1},{y1},{x2},{y2} -t 560 -s 3000 -f 0.0 --leavesign --norender

If the generator doesn’t run under the time limit, decrease the ‘-t’ flag’s input.

To demonstrate the iterative rendering of agents, use something like:
python3 run.py -a {x1},{y1},{x2},{y2} -t 560 -s 2000 -f 0.3 --leavesign


# Installing the HTTP Interface
Install Forge

Download and install Minecraft Forge for 1.16.5 here.

You need to own a copy of Minecraft (Java Version) and have it installed on your machine.

Get the Forge Mod Launcher (Download Recommended -> Installer) and install it (client install, but server should work, too). The latest version I tested is 1.16.5-36.1.0, but newer versions should work, too.

Open your Minecraft Launcher, the Forge Installation should have appeared there.

Open your mod folder. To do this open the Forge Installation you just installed and click the "Mods" button and then the "Open mods folder" button (You can skip this step by just navigating to %APPDATA%/.minecraft/mods).

Move .jar file from this repository into the mod folder.

Restart Minecraft and launch the Forge Installation again. The mod should now appear in the mod list under "Mods".

When you open a world the HTTP Server will be started automatically, and you should now be able to send HTTP requests to it.
